    The NuGet package for StyleCop does not include StyleCop.CSharp.Rules.dll.
    There is a StyleCop.MSBuild package which has everything we need.
    Still we do not use it since it does ugly transforms on the project file. 
    A simple workaround is to add the StyleCop.MSBuild
    package to the solution and to import its included targets file.

    Now all projects depend on a specific version and, when StyleCop.MSBuild
    gets updated, all projects will fail to load. This is far from perfect but
    at least we are immediately notified of the problem.
