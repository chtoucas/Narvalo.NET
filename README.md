Narvalo.NET
===========

Right now, a place for me to test various ideas.

As such, mostly broken.

The most stable parts are:

- Narvalo.Common, a set of common utilities
- Narvalo.Web
- Narvalo.Web.Extras
- Narvalo.Mvp, a simple MVP framework inspired by WebFormsMvp
- Narvalo.Mvp.Web, enhances Narvalo.Mvp to provide support for ASP.NET WebForms.
