ChangeLog (2015-03-26)
======================

_Version 0.23 of Narvalo.Core, Narvalo.Common & Narvalo.Web_

## Highlights
- Aiming for API stability of Narvalo.Core.

## Breaking Changes
- Renamed `VoidOrBreak.Abort()` to `VoidOrBreak.Break()`, `VoidOrBreak.Aborted` to `VoidOrBreak.IsBreak`
  and `VoidOrBreak.Success` to `VoidOrBreak.Void`.
- Renamed `VoidOrError.Failure()` to `VoidOrError.Error()` and `VoidOrError.Success` to `VoidOrError.Void`.
- Renamed `Sequence.Create()` to `Sequence.Generate()`.

## Enhancements
- New `Promise` class to make promises and check them.
- New `Assume` class to help the Code Contracts tools recognize that certain conditions are met.
- Provides unsafe alternates to some extension methods for `SqlParameterCollection` and `SqlCommand`.
  These unsafe methods delegate parameter validation to the caller.
- New validation method: `Require.PropertyNotWhiteSpace()`.

## Improvements
- `Require.PropertyNotEmpty()` no longer throws an `ArgumentNullException`.
- Whenever it was possible, moved `SqlDataReader` extensions to `IDataRecord` extensions.
- We no longer patch the documentation with Code Contracts annotations; this created too
  much noise and annoying duplicates of descriptions for exceptions. The patched documentation
  is still available in the NuGet package alongside the contract assemblies.
- Added more Code Contracts.
- Changed a few parameter names to ensure a CA1303 error is triggered whenever
  a string should be localized.
