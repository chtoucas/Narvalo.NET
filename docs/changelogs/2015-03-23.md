ChangeLog (2015-03-23)
======================

_Version 0.22 of Narvalo.Core, Narvalo.Common & Narvalo.Web_

## Highlights
- Focus on API and code quality of Narvalo.Core.

## Breaking Changes
- To improve usability, merged most of the `Narvalo.Collections` namespace with
  `Narvalo.Fx` and moved almost all others classes to Narvalo.Common.
  Narvalo.Core is now focused on implementing functional patterns and a minimal set
  of helpers, namely what is necessary to perform argument validation.
- Moved from `Require` to `Enforce` all methods that do not play well with Code Contracts.
- Renamed `Maybe.Create()` to `Maybe.Of()` and `Range.Create()` to `Range.Of()`.
- Apply to all monads: renamed `Apply()` to `Invoke()`, `Match()` to `Map()` and
  changed the signature of `When()` and `Then()`.
- Moved the `UriExtensions` class to Narvalo.Web as it is only useful there.

## API Changes
- New types inspired by functional programming: `Output<T>`, `Either<T1, T2>`, `Switch<T1, T2>`...
- New types to help writing na√Øve benchmarks.
- Made the `Maybe<T>.IsSome` property public; there was no compelling reason to continue hiding it.

## Enhancements
- Narvalo.Core fully passes FxCop, Gendarme and Code Contracts static analysis.
- Added more C# documentation.
- Follow more closely the coding style recommandations by the .NET team.
