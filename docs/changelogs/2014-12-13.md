ChangeLog (2014-12-13)
======================

_Version 0.19.0 of Narvalo.Core, Narvalo.Common & Narvalo.Web_

### Highlights
- New Code Contracts assemblies. Plenty of small bugfixes.

### Bugfixes
- When building a PCL project _from the command line_, MSBuild generates output inside a subdirectory
  of `$(OutDir)`. To correct this, we instruct MSBuild to not change the default behaviour:
  `$(GenerateProjectSpecificOutputFolder) = false`.
- Narvalo.Facts fails when called from Make.proj and run twice in a row.
  Narvalo.Core and Narvalo.Common use the default namespace (namely `Narvalo`)
  and both define a resource named `SR.resx` (with default access modifier kept,
  that is internal) which confused .NET when trying to resolve one of the string
  resources. I have not found the reason but, when running the tests
  from the command line, the resource embedded in Narvalo.Core got replaced
  by the one in Narvalo.Common. The solution was to use different names for
  both resources.
