ChangeLog (2014-12-17)
======================

_Version 0.19.1 of Narvalo.Core, Narvalo.Common & Narvalo.Web_

### Highlights
- No API changes. Correct a problem with NuGet and Code Contracts.

### Bugfixes
- When adding a NuGet package, the Code Contracts library was incorrectly added
  to the project references. To help NuGet identify _true_ references, we just
  have to use the section "references" in the nuspec files.

### Enhancements
- Allowed for local customization of the build process. If we find a file
  named {AssemblyName}.props in the project root, it will be loaded at the very
  end of Narvalo.Common.props. The same holds true for {AssemblyName}.targets
  and Narvalo.Common.targets. Thanks to this, we can instruct the projects
  that do not yet pass CA or SA to use a relaxed set of rules. A warning is
  raised when it is the case, so that we don't forget to fix this later on.

### Improvements
- It is now possible to unconditionally hide internal classes and methods of an
  assembly. On the way, we fixed CA issues that appear when this is turned on.
