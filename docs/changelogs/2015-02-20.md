ChangeLog (2015-02-20)
======================

_Version 0.21 of Narvalo.Core & Narvalo.Common_

## Highlights
- Bugfix for currency types.

## Bugfixes
- Use 0 for the numeric code for a currency when none is defined. Before that, we  registered the
  alphabetic code but not the currency info since we didn't have a numeric code.

## Improvements
- Removed from the currency classes anything related to culture, namely the currency symbol methods.
  We need a better way of handling localization problems. Unicode CLDR seems the way to go.
