HTML Optimizations
==================

Work related to HTML optimizations would have not been
possible without other open source contributors. I owe a lot to this
[blog](http://omari-o.blogspot.com/2009/09/aspnet-white-space-cleaning-with-no.html)
to understand the ASP.NET WebForms side of things and
[Meleze.Web](https://github.com/meleze/Meleze.Web)
served as a great inspiration while trying to understand
how something similar could be done with Razor.

Other interesting informations regarding `PageParserFilter` may be found here:
