Build Infrastructure
====================

Extra care has been taken to completely isolate the CI environment and to keep
the development inside Visual Studio as smooth and swift as it can be.

Build Scripts
-------------

The main build script is `make.ps1` at the root of the repository,
it comes with complete documentation:
- Use `make.ps1 -h` to display the help.
- Use `make.ps1 -docs` to display the list of available tasks.

### Make.proj and Make.Foundations.proj
