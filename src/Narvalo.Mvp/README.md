Features a MVP framework very largely inspired by [Web Forms MVP](https://github.com/webformsmvp/webformsmvp).
Contrary to Web Forms MVP, it is not restricted to the WebForms platform;
nevertheless, featurewise, it should be on par with the original Web Forms Mvp.

Most (if not all) credits should go to the markers of Web Forms MVP,
of course if you find any error I am the one to be blamed for.
