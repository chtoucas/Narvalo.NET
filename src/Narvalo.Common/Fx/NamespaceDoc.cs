     * On Monads
     * ---------
     * 
     * You shouldn't be afraid of the monad! You don't need to understand the theory behind to make good use of it, really.
     * In fact, I guess that the monad theory, or more precisely category theory, has influenced the design of many
     * parts of the .NET framework ; Linq and the Reactive Extensions being the most obvious proofs of that.
     * The .NET type system is not rich enough to make very general monadic constructions but it gives developpers
     * access to some powerful (untold) monadic concepts in a very friendly way.
     * 
     * Implemented monads:
     * + Maybe<T>
     * 
     * Planned monads:
     * + Either<T1, T2>
     * + Outcome<T>
     * + State
